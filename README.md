## How to useÂ Tumm?

You only need to do is adding new currency into to main (converter) screen. You can add as many currencies as you want! Tap the "SELL" currency value to change it. Change value by typing the keyboard, all currency values will be changed automatically on each type.
Any feedback about the experience? I would love to hear from you!

## Where did the idea comeÂ from?

The idea of converting currencies is not so different and unique as you know. Obviously, I hadn't thought too much on it. I have been already using a currency converter app, it is unnecessarily complex to use it. So I decided to make a new one with a goal: keep it simple and add some fancy features on it!

The main reason behind developing a hobby project is:
- Learning new things,
- Applying things that you've learned,
- Demonstrating my coding style and getting feedback from people,
- Practicing all-the-time so I can keep things that I learned fresh,
- Improving skills, acquiring new ones.

For getting all of the things above to happen, I decided to make everything open-source and I loved that idea!

## Version 1.0 is openÂ source

I decided to make it public as far as I can go. Luckily, I used a public exchange rate API. So the API key is not required to use it. I hav continued to develop the Tumm until adding Firebase & AdMob SDK's. There had to be some credentials, so I had to fork the repo to a private one. Version 1.0 can be reachable from this repo and always will be.

## Tech stack

You can look at the code if you are interested but I want to summarize the tech stack that I prefer in short:
* Swift 4.2
* MVVMâ€Š - â€Š_architectural design pattern_
* Clean architectureâ€Š - â€Š_using an app router and container, builders, contracts_
* CoreDataâ€Š - â€Š_to store currencies_
* XCTestsâ€Š - â€Š_with low test coverage_
* Bitriseâ€Š - â€Š_CI&CD tool (If you interested in using Bitrise, this article that I wrote about a month ago might be helpful for you)_
